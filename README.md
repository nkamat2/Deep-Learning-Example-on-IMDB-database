# Deep-Learning-Example-on-IMDB-database
We'll be working with "IMDB dataset", a set of 50,000 highly-polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. 
They are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting in 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.
We will try to find optimum validation accuracy and test accuracy by using differnet number of hidden layers, activation functions and loss functions.
We will also use Regularization and Dropout functions in the model to improve the accuracy.
